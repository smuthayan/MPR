# MPR
MPR (Mouse Position Recorder)
This program is a mouse/cursor position recorder. It outputs your mouse coordinates everytime you move your cursor with respect to the delay in milliseconds. NOTE: This program does not record duplicate coordinates. I.E If your hotkeys are pressed at x and y coordinates and you don't move your mouse, it won't continually print out x and y.
